# TuVosUsted

TúVosUsted is an app for anyone that uses Spanish when they travel. Whether you're a Spanish student taking a vacation in Colombia or a Mexican visiting family in Spain, TúVosUsted helps you find the appropriate form of you for your location and conversation. Just answer 2-3 simple questions based on the conversation and we'll tell you whether to use tú, vos, or usted. The app was made to be bilingual (English and Spanish) to accommodate for beginner-level Spanish students.
